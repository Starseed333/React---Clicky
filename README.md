# **React---Clicky**


### **Description**

A Star Wars full stack application memory game using React. The application 's UI is broken down into components, it manages the components state, and it also responds to the user events.  The application renders twelve Star Wars images on to the screen which keeps track of the user score by image. Every image listens to click events. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time the user clicks on the image the images shuffle themselves in a random order.  This is accomplished using the React-Shuffle NPM Package. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts! The game sure does test your memory skills!
